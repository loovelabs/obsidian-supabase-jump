# Changelog

All notable changes to SupaBase Jump will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- ESLint fixs

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- ESLint fixs

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Fixed the bug where if DB has newer content than local disk, the local disk will be overwritten with the DB content even if the user has edited the file locally.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Real-time collaborative editing** - Two devices using the same account can now edit the same note simultaneously without conflicts. Yjs CRDTs are used for automatic, conflict-free merging; updates are broadcast ephemerally over a Supabase Realtime channel so the database is not bloated. Syncs instantly as you type with a character-level patches to the editor (no full replace, no duplication).
- **Platform-specific config paths** - Settings now include a toggle panel listing the most common Obsidian config files (`appearance.json`, `themes/`, `snippets/`, `plugins/`, `community-plugins.json`, `hotkeys.json`, `workspace.json`). Toggle a path to make it sync only to the current platform (mobile or desktop). A free-text "Custom paths" field covers anything not in the list.
- **`platform` column in `vault_files`** - Each row is tagged as `'all'`, `'mobile'`, or `'desktop'`. Pull operations skip rows tagged for a different platform.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- UI name capitalization
- ESLint fixs

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Frontmatter parsing** - Markdown frontmatter properties and tags are now extracted on every push and stored in dedicated `frontmatter` (jsonb) and `tags` (text[]) columns in `vault_files`, enabling rich SQL queries directly from your Supabase dashboard (e.g. filter by tag, author, status, date, etc.)
- **Config folder sync** - The `.obsidian/` directory is now synced automatically, including themes, appearance settings, snippets, and other plugin config files
    - A 5-second polling watcher detects changes Obsidian writes directly to disk (bypasses vault events)
    - Toggle on/off per vault via **Settings → Sync config folder** (default: on)
    - Works with the full Obsidian config directory regardless of its configured name

### Changed

- Database schema: `vault_files` gains `frontmatter jsonb` and `tags text[]` columns; existing tables are migrated automatically via `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
- A GIN index on `tags` is created for fast array queries

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-16

### Technical Details

- **Database schema**: `vault_files` table with RLS policies
- **Storage bucket**: `vault-attachments` (private)
- **Realtime**: PostgreSQL publication on `vault_files`
- **Row ID format**: `{vaultId}::{filePath}` (slashes → `__SLASH__`)
- **Storage key format**: `{userId}/{vaultId}/{base64url(filePath)}{ext}`
- **Build system**: esbuild (ES2018 target, CJS output)
- **Type checking**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Linting**: ESLint with Obsidian plugin

### Known Limitations

- No merge conflict UI (last-write-wins only)
- No version history (single-version sync)
- No selective file sync (all-or-nothing per folder)
- Supabase Management API bucket creation may fail on some project types (manual fallback provided)
