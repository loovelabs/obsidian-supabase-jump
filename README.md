## Demo

## Features

- **Real-time sync** - Changes propagate instantly across all your devices via Supabase Realtime
- **Conflict resolution** - Newer files always win (based on modification time)
- **Binary file support** - Images, PDFs, and other attachments sync via Supabase Storage
- **Selective sync** - Exclude specific folders from syncing
- **Mobile compatible** - Works on both desktop and mobile Obsidian
- **One-click setup** - Automated database and storage configuration
- **Offline-first** - Local changes are queued and synced when you reconnect

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key** from **Settings → API**

### 2. Install the Plugin

#### From Obsidian Community Plugins (Recommended)

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins**
2. Disable **Restricted mode** if enabled
3. Search for **"SupaBase Jump"**
4. Click **Install**, then **Enable**

#### Manual Installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/brianstm/obsidian-supabase-jump/releases)
2. Create a folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/supabase-jump/`
3. Copy the three files into that folder
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**

### 3. Configure the Plugin

1. Open **Settings → SupaBase Jump**
2. In the **Initial Setup** section:
   - Generate a **Personal Access Token** at [supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)
   - Paste it into the **Personal access token** field
   - Click **Run full setup** - this creates the database table, storage bucket, and enables Realtime
3. Fill in your credentials:
   - **Supabase URL** - Your project URL (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **Supabase anon key** - Your anon/public key
   - **Email** - Your Supabase account email
   - **Password** - Your Supabase account password
4. Click **Connect**

That's it! Your vault will start syncing automatically.

## Usage

### Automatic Sync

Once connected, the plugin automatically:
- Pushes local changes to Supabase (debounced by 2 seconds)
- Pulls remote changes from other devices in real time
- Syncs on startup (if **Sync on startup** is enabled)
- Syncs periodically based on your **Sync interval** setting

### Manual Sync

Use the **Actions** section in settings:
- **Sync now** - Full two-way sync (push + pull)
- **Fetch now** - Pull remote changes without pushing local files

Or use the command palette:
- `SupaBase Jump: Force sync now`
- `SupaBase Jump: Fetch from database`
- `SupaBase Jump: Show sync status`

### Exclude Folders

To exclude folders from syncing (e.g., `.obsidian`, `.trash`, `Templates`):
1. Go to **Settings → SupaBase Jump**
2. Add folder paths to **Excluded folders** (comma-separated)
3. Example: `.obsidian,.trash,Templates`

System folders (`.obsidian/`, `.trash/`) are always excluded automatically.

## How It Works

### Architecture

- **Text files** (`.md`, `.txt`, etc.) - Content stored directly in the `vault_files` PostgreSQL table
- **Binary files** (images, PDFs, etc.) - Uploaded to Supabase Storage; metadata in `vault_files`
- **Realtime sync** - Supabase Realtime broadcasts changes to all connected clients
- **Conflict resolution** - Higher `mtime` (modification time) wins

### Database Schema

The plugin creates a `vault_files` table with:
- `id` (primary key) - `{vaultId}::{filePath}` (slashes replaced with `__SLASH__`)
- `vault_id` - Unique ID for your vault (auto-generated)
- `path` - File path relative to vault root
- `content` - File content (for text files)
- `storage_path` - Supabase Storage key (for binary files)
- `mtime`, `ctime`, `size` - File metadata
- `deleted` - Soft-delete flag
- `user_id` - Row-level security (RLS) ensures you only see your own files

### Storage Bucket

Binary files are stored in a private `vault-attachments` bucket with:
- RLS policies ensuring users can only access their own files
- Base64url-encoded keys to handle special characters in filenames
- Original file extensions preserved for MIME type inference

## Troubleshooting

### "Setup failed at step 1/2/3"

- **Step 1 (Database)** - Check your Personal Access Token is valid and has the required permissions
- **Step 2 (Storage bucket)** - If auto-creation fails, manually create a bucket named `vault-attachments` (Private) in **Supabase → Storage**
- **Step 3 (RLS policy)** - Ensure your Supabase project has the `storage` schema enabled

### "Email not confirmed"

If you see this error after connecting:
1. Check your email inbox for a confirmation link from Supabase
2. Click the link to confirm your account
3. Click **Connect** again in the plugin settings

Or disable email confirmation:
1. Go to **Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Email**
2. Uncheck **"Confirm email"**

### Files not syncing

1. Check the status bar (bottom-right) - it should show **🟢 Synced**
2. Open the browser console (**Ctrl+Shift+I** / **Cmd+Option+I**) and look for errors
3. Verify your **Vault ID** is set in settings
4. Check that the file path isn't in your **Excluded folders** list
5. Try **Sync now** manually from settings

### "Invalid key" errors

The plugin automatically handles special characters in filenames by base64url-encoding storage keys. If you still see this error:
1. Ensure you're running the latest version of the plugin
2. Check the browser console for the full error message
3. Report the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/brianstm/obsidian-supabase-jump/issues) with the filename
